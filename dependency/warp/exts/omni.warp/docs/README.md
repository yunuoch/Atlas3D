# Warp [omni.warp]

This extension provides a collection of OmniGraph nodes and sample scenes demonstrating uses of Warp in OmniGraph.

This extension automatically enables the omni.warp.core extension, which allows Warp to be used by calling `import warp`
in Python code.

## About Warp

NVIDIA Warp is a Python framework for writing high-performance simulation and graphics code.
Compute kernels are defined in Python syntax and JIT converted to C++/CUDA and compiled at runtime.

## Sample Scenes

This extension adds several scenes that showcase the use of Warp in OmniGraph to the Sample Browser under the "Warp" category.
The Sample-Browser tab can be shown by selecting Window -> Browsers -> Examples.

The location of the USD files and assets on disk can be opened in a file browser by selecting Window -> Warp -> Sample Scenes.

## OmniGraph Nodes

The OmniGraph nodes added by this extension are found under the "Warp" category
in the OmniGraph Editor's node library.

## Documentation

A webpage containing material to get started using Warp in Omniverse can be opened in a web browser by selecting
Window -> Warp -> Getting Started.

The online Warp documentation can be accessed by selecting Window -> Warp -> Documentation, which automatically opens
a web browser at https://nvidia.github.io/warp.
